A crate for typechecking.. A typecheking generator?

## What's this? 
Have you encountered [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom), [chumsky](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky), [pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest) etc. for parsers? Well, this is my take at making something like it but for *typecheckers* 

## Note
Development on this project will start on 24th December 2022 :)
